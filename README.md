# Building Interactive Dashboards with Plotly and Dash

This lab introduces [**Plotly**](https://plotly.com) and [**Dash**](https://dash.plotly.com), focusing on the creation of interactive web-based analytics applications using Python. Interactivity is very important in data analytics, as it enables users to explore data from multiple perspectives, adjust the level of analysis, and customize data presentation.

## The Role of Dashboards in Data Analytics

Dashboards are essential tools for data visualization and analysis, designed to display the most critical information on a single screen to facilitate quick monitoring and decision-making. They are particularly effective in presenting large volumes of data in an easy-to-understand format through various types of visualizations like charts and tables.

### Key Features of Dashboards:

- **Consolidation of Information**: Dashboards aggregate the most important data needed to achieve specific objectives, allowing for quick information assessment at a glance.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Many dashboards are set up to update in real-time, providing up-to-the-minute data that is crucial for monitoring ongoing processes or activities.
- **Decision Support**: Dashboards support decision making processes by highlighting key performance indicators (KPIs), which are essential for measuring success against predefined goals.
- **Interactivity**: Usually, they incporporate rich interactive features, enabling users to drill down into details, adjust analytical parameters, and customize data presentations to better suit their analysis.

#### Some examples of dashboards developed with Plotly and Dash can be found [here](https://plotly.com/examples/).


In this lab, you will learn the fundamentals of Plotly to create interactive visualizations. You will also delve into the essentials of Dash, exploring its components to design the layout of a dashboard and implement callbacks to add interactivity.

## Pre-requisites
